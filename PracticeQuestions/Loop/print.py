# Write a program to print multiplication table of a given number using for loop.
i =0
for i in range(10,0, -1): # -1 denote backward 
    print(f"5 * {i} = {5 * i}")

# Attempt problem 1 using while loop.
# i = 0
# while i <=10:
#     print(f"5 * {i} = {5 * i}")
#     i +=1


# Write a program to greet all the person names stored in a list ‘l’ and which starts with S
